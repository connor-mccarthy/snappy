    The {command_style(name)} command validates the structure of your project. This evaluation happens relative to the working directory where the command is run.

    The structure requirements are:
    * One {file_style(APP_FILE)} file beneath working directory
    * One {file_style(REQUIREMENTS_FILE)} file in the same directory as your {file_style(APP_FILE)} file
    * One {file_style(YAML_FILE)} file in the same directory as your {file_style(APP_FILE)} file.

    If there is no {file_style(YAML_FILE)} file in your project, you will be prompted to create one with the {command_style(InitCommand.name)} command.
